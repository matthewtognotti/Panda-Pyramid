# Pick and Place with Franka Emika Panda

- Pyramid.py is a script that places 6 small boxes into a pyramid using the Franka Emika Panda manipulator with the MoveIt python interface.

- The script uses some of the functions from the [MoveIt python interface tutorial](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/blob/melodic-devel/doc/move_group_python_interface/scripts/move_group_python_interface_tutorial.py)

- The script provides the option to sequentially choose which box to place and an option to place all remaining boxes.
